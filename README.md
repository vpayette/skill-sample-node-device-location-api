## What Your Skill Will Do
The device location API enables skills to request and access the configured address in the customer’s device settings. This means you can build skills with the context to understand the customers who use the skill, then use the data to customize the voice experience. Your skill, for example, can deliver food and groceries to a customer’s home or provide directions to a nearby gym. You can also see where your most active users are. Check out our documentation to learn more.

When a user enables a skill with the Alexa app that wants to use location data, the user will be prompted to provide consent for location data to be made available.
